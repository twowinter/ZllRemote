Z-Stack Core Release Notes

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 2.6.1
November 26, 2013


Notices:
 - Z-Stack 2.6.1 has been certified for ZigBee-PRO compliance and supports
   the ZigBee 2012 specification.

 - Z-Stack for the CC2520 and CC2530 platforms has been built and tested with
   IAR's CLIB library, which provides a light-weight C library which does not
   support Embedded C++. Use of DLIB is not recommended for those platforms.
   Z-Stack for the CC2538 platform has been tested with the DLIB library.

 - Z-Stack projects specify compile options in two ways: (1) "-D" statements
   in f8wConfig.cfg and other *.cfg files, (2) entries in the IDE Compiler
   Preprocessor Defined Symbols. When using the EW8051 or EW430 compilers,
   settings made in the IDE will override settings in the *.cfg files. When
   using the EWARM compiler, settings in the *.cfg files will override any
   made in the IDE.

 - When programming devices for the first time with this release, the entire
   Flash memory should be erased. For the CC2530 and EXP5438 platforms, select
   "Erase Flash" in the "Debugger->Texas Instruments->Download" tab of the
   project options. For the CC2538, select "Project->Download->Erase Memory".

 - Library and hex files were built and tested with the following versions of
   IAR tools and may not work with different versions of the IAR tools:
     - CC2538 + SRF06EB:  EWARM 6.50.5 (6.50.5.4862)
     - CC2530 + SRF05EB:  EW8051 8.20.2 (8.20.2.41139)
     - CC2530 + EXP5438:  EW430 5.51.6 (5.51.6.50669)
     - CC2520 + EXP5438:  EW430 5.51.6 (5.51.6.50669)

 - Foundation software library files for the CC2538 include the following:
     - bsp.lib, version 1.3.1
     - driverlib.lib, version 1.3.1
     - usblib.lib, version 1.0.1


Changes:
 - [5314] Made it possible to exclude the Child Aging feature by commenting
   out the "ZIGBEE_CHILD_AGING" compile flag in 'nwk_globals.h'. This allows
   code size reduction when Child Aging is not needed in an application,
   approximately 2K bytes for Routers on CC2530 platforms.

 - [5278] Removed all aspects of the HIGH SECURITY mode, which are expected
   to be deleted from the R21 version of the ZigBee Core Specification. This
   results in code reduction of approximately 1K bytes on CC2530 platforms.

 - [5166] Modified 'ZDO_RegisterForZDOMsg()' to allow tasks to register for
   all ZDO response messages and device announce by using the new clusterID
   definition of "ZDO_ALL_MSGS_CLUSTERID".

 - [5105] Made it possible to exclude the mechanism to prevent the Binding
   process from leaving Address Manager entries with "INVALID_NODE_ADDR" by
   using the "ZDP_BIND_SKIP_VALIDATION" compile flag. This allows code size
   reduction of approximately 1K bytes on CC2530 platforms. See [4748].

 - [4945] Replaced the global 16-bit 'zgTrustCenterAddr' variable with new
   64-bit 'apsTrustCenterAddress' AIB item. When 'apsTrustCenterAddress' is
   set to 0xFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF, distributed security is enacted, like in ZLL
   ad-hoc networks, and is externalized over the air in the Transport-Key
   APS command. Note that NV item "ZCD_NV_TRUSTCENTER_ADDR" has changed to
   0x0071 (from 0x006E).


Bug Fixes:
 - [5329] Modified 'OnBoard_KeyCallback()' to change the result of pressing
   the SELECT button on the SmartRF06EB to "HAL_KEY_SW_5" instead of "SHIFT"
   +"HAL_KEY_SW_5". Since there's no appropriate SHIFT button on this board,
   it is hardwired to FALSE.

 - [5300] Fixed the "SW_BYPASS_NV" feature on CC2538 platforms. Pressing the
   RIGHT button on the SmartRF06EB while the device is reset now causes the
   NV restore to be bypassed.

 - [5284] Modified APSME_TCLinkKeySync() to remove verification of the Rx
   FrameCounter in TC Link Key when configured as GLOBAL LINK KEY.

 - [5266] Fixed a possible parameter stack corruption issue in initNV() for
   the CC2538, where the 'readHdr()' function (moves 16 bytes) was used to
   get a "pgHdr" (8 bytes).

 - [5216] Fixed incorrect Transaction ID in AF_DATA_CONFIRM_CMD message sent
   back to application when a fragmented message was sent over the air.

 - [5167] Fixed a problem on CC2538 devices where AES hardware could hang
   under heavy encryption/decryption operations. See 'hal_mcu.h' for new
   macros "HAL_AES_ENTER_WORKAROUND()" and "HAL_AES_EXIT_WORKAROUND()".

 - [5135] Fixed a problem in 'ZDO_ProcessMgmtLeaveReq()' where an end-device
   continued polling its parent after properly processing a Mgmt_Leave_Req
   message with rejoin set to 0.

 - [5093] Modified the routing next hop selection to consider using an entry
   from the routing table instead of directly sending to a neighbor if the
   neighbor's link quality is poor (cost >= MAX_LINK_COST/2).
   
 - [5092] Improved the calculation of the averaged Link Quality by updating
   only when a message from a neighbor is received with success status.

 - [5080] Corrected a possible use of uninitialized variable in the function
   'APSME_FrameTunnel()' which could return the wrong status if the frame was
   not sent due to memory allocation failure.

 - [5059] Redesigned the 'zcl_BuildAnalogData()' function to properly handle
   data types that are greater than 4 bytes long, taking device endianness
   into account.

 - [5057] Modified 'ZDO_LeaveInd()' to not send a "Leave Response" message
   if the device is going to "rejoin" the network.

 - [4856] Improved processing of Route Requests to avoid "back-to-back"
   requests to the same destination.

 - [4855] Fixed a problem in the handling of circular routes where the last
   destination address (hop radius exhausted) is the source of the packet.

 - [4748] Added a mechanism to prevent the Binding process from creating
   entries in the Address Manager table with invalid NWK address when the
   NwkAdressRsp message is never received - this prevents unused entries
   from wasting space in the Address Manager table.

 - [3406] Fixed a problem where the NWK framecounter was not saved to NV if
   the device was reset right after joining the network or when the device
   was subjected to heavy traffic.


Known Issues:
 - Processing of Manufacturer Specific foundation commands is not supported.

 - To disable security at build time, use the "SECURE=0" compile option. Do
   not attempt to disable security by setting the SECURITY_LEVEL to zero.

 - The ZDO Complex Descriptor is not supported.
